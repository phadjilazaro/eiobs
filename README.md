Algorithm and data to reproduce the figures of "Environmental responsibility and exposure of finance: combining Environmentally-extended Input-Output and Balance Sheet approaches" (Paul Hadji-Lazaro, 2023).

You should be aware that some matrix calculations take a long time to perform.

The file "20230630.csv" (BACH data) and the folder "IOT_2019_ixi" (Exiobase data)  are missing from the data folder as they are too large data sets. They can be found at the following links:
